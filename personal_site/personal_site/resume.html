        <h2>Profile</h2>
        <p> My name is Elizabeth Jane Salinas, and I am a digital media artist. I have loved art for as long as I can remember, and my family has always encouraged me to pursue my renaissance of talents. Growing up, I drew and painted constantly. In 6th grade, after I received an iPad for Christmas, I made my first film. Death at a Wedding was a 30-minute movie that featured my siblings as the cast. This is where it all started, I was thrown into the world of video & photo-editing, and later digital illustrations. I created dozens more works during that time, experimenting with a range of apps and processes. By 2020 I was working with “grown-up” versions of these platforms like Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator.  

          At Gavilan College, my appreciation for art and communication studies came together when I double-majored in two AA certificates. It was there that I came to understand how art is another form of communication between people, I genuinely believe that this has helped me grow as a person. The truth that underlies all of my work is the understanding of how human perception works. 
   
          I have been working at Harman Management, a KFC Franchisee, for over four years now. I have been creating logos, flyers, posters, postcards, programs, and magazines for the programs and communications department for the past two and a half years. One of my first projects was the company’s 150+ page yearbook. I will admit, that I knew nothing about Adobe InDesign when I first started, yet I was able to catch on quickly, I spent hours each week experimenting with the program learning everything I could to become a proficient creator. What I love about this is that even on the career side of my work, I am still able to express my creativity. 
   
          For years now I have known that I wanted to join a higher art program, and I believe that the DMA BFA is it. I know that this program will give me the chance to fully express my capabilities and talent. I want to improve my work and learn more about the other ways I can use these tools to improve viewer’s experiences. A huge inspiration for my work is nature. Lately, the philosophy of 19th-century Romantics is something that I have been intrigued with. It is fascinating to consider how the environment continues to play a role in contemporary art, despite this digitalized age we are in. I am also motivated by themes of feminism and intersectionality, viewing art history from varying perspectives will have me absorbed for hours. I am familiar with html, css, and javascript coding, along with the other systems listed above. However, I want to focus more on the creative side of the DMA program, such as video, fabrication, and rendering. I believe these are the subjects that need to be developed further in my work.</p>
